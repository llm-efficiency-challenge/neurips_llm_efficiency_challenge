# âš¡ Lit-GPT

Hackable [implementation](lit_gpt/model.py) of state-of-the-art open-source large language models released under the **Apache 2.0 license**.

Supports popular public checkpoints such as:

- TII UAE [Falcon](tutorials/download_falcon.md)
- OpenLM Research [OpenLLaMA](tutorials/download_openllama.md)
- LMSYS [Vicuna](tutorials/download_vicuna.md) and [LongChat](tutorials/download_longchat.md)
- Together [RedPajama-INCITE](tutorials/download_redpajama_incite.md)
- EleutherAI [Pythia](tutorials/download_pythia.md)
- StabilityAI [StableLM](tutorials/download_stablelm.md)

This implementation extends on [Lit-LLaMA](https://github.com/lightning-AI/lit-llama) and [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT), and it's **powered by [Lightning Fabric](https://lightning.ai/docs/fabric/stable/) âš¡**.

## Design principles

This repository follows the main principle of **openness through clarity**.

**Lit-GPT** is:

- **Simple:** Single-file implementation without boilerplate.
- **Correct:** Numerically equivalent to the original model.
- **Optimized:** Runs fast on consumer hardware or at scale.
- **Open-source:** No strings attached.

Avoiding code duplication is **not** a goal. **Readability** and **hackability** are.

## Setup

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt
cd lit-gpt
```

Lit-GPT currently relies on flash attention from PyTorch nightly. Until PyTorch 2.1 is released you'll need to install nightly manually.
Luckily that is straightforward:

**On CUDA**

```bash
pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu118 --pre 'torch>=2.1.0dev'
```

**On CPU (incl Macs)**

```bash
pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu --pre 'torch>=2.1.0dev'
```

All good, now install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are all set! ðŸŽ‰

## Use the model

To generate text predictions, you need to download the model weights. **If you don't have them, check out our [guide](tutorials/download_stablelm.md).**

Run inference:

```bash
python generate/base.py --prompt "Hello, my name is"
```

This will run the 3B pre-trained model and require ~7 GB of GPU memory using the `bfloat16` datatype.

[Full guide for generating samples from the model](tutorials/inference.md).

You can also chat with the model interactively:

```bash
python chat/base.py
```

### Run large models on smaller consumer devices

We support 4-bit quantization (as in QLoRA), LLM.int8, and GPTQ.int4 inference by following [this guide](tutorials/quantize.md).

## Finetune the model

We provide a simple training scripts (`finetune/adapter.py`, `finetune/adapter_v2.py`, and `finetune/lora.py`) that instruction-tunes a pretrained model on the [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca) dataset.

1. Download the data and generate an instruction tuning dataset:

```bash
python scripts/prepare_alpaca.py
```

2. Run the finetuning script

For example, you can either use

Adapter ([Zhang et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16199)):

```bash
python finetune/adapter.py
```

or Adapter v2 ([Gao et al. 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15010)):

```bash
python finetune/adapter_v2.py
```

or LoRA ([Hu et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685)):

```bash
python finetune/lora.py
```

(Please see the [tutorials/finetune_adapter](tutorials/finetune_adapter.md) for details on the differences between the two adapter methods.)

The finetuning requires at least one GPU with ~12 GB memory (RTX 3060).

It is expected that you have downloaded the pretrained weights as described above.
More details about each finetuning method and how you can apply it to your own data can be found in our technical how-to guides.

### Finetuning How-To Guides

These technical tutorials illustrate how to run the finetuning code.
